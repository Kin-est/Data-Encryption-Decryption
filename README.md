# Data-Encryption-Decryption
Prototype of Data Encryption and Decryption using AES and RSA
Data Encryption Decryption is aimed to provide a security layer to data so that if the data is stolen in the case then the data receiver must not be able to see the data. We used two encryption layers which are AES and RSA layer. Any file like music, video, pdf or text file can be encrypted using this program. This is a prototype of the ASE project.
